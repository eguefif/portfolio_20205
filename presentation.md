I'm Emmanuel, former programmer hobbyist, currently programmer professional and, technology enthousiast.

Not a long time ago, I was teacher teaching in my 4th grade in Victoria, BC, Canada.  I work now as a software developer in a digital book company, and I love what I do.

The carreer switch was no surprise for the people who know me since I was a teenage. Back then, I've learn programming with a book on C and php. I then enrolled in a math and computer science program at University Lyon 1. In the meantime, I got engage in a student organisation and I discovered a world that I did not know. And because I like to know more when I don't, I kept going, studied sociology and ended up as an elementary school teacher. Coming back to programming was just a new start. But I was not starting over. I always programmed from time to time as a hobby.

I love programming, building and solving problem. As a proof of that, I fast tracked 42 Québec common core not because I'm the smartest, but becaues I can spend a lot of time studying computer science and alos because I prepared before that. I am not one to wait someone to tell me how to learn, I'd rather learned through books and projects. That's why 42 was the best choice.
