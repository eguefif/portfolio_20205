Hi, I'm Emmanuel. I program computers for a living, play music for unwinding, and I love building things!

I created my first program at 14. I decided not to wait for a university teacher. It was a GCD calculator in QBasic. When I got into university, my curiosity drove me to sociology and I ended up working as an elementary school teacher. I wanted to pass on my love for learning to my students and nurture their curiosity!

I came back to programming after meeting one of my father's students when I was teaching in Victoria, Canada. He was a Python specialist and I was fascinated by what he taught me about programming. I enrolled at 42 Québec, finished the common core studying 50 hours a week, found an internship and right after, a job.

I know how to learn and I love learning. It's not only about programming but also about what people do in their lives. I have a keen interest in translating real-world problems into software solutions.
