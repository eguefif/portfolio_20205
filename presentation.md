I'm Emmanuel, a software developer and technology enthusiast.

Not long ago, I was teaching 4th grade in Victoria, BC, Canada. Now I work as a software developer in a digital book company, and I love what I do.

My career switch wasn't surprising to those who know me. As a teenager, I learned programming with books on C and PHP, then studied math and computer science at University Lyon 1. Through student organizations, I discovered sociology and became an elementary school teacher. But I never stopped programming as a hobby. Returning to software development was a new start, not starting over.

I love programming and solving problems. I fast-tracked 42 Québec's common core through dedication and preparation—I'm a self-learner who prefers books and projects over waiting to be taught.
