# Ray Tracer

This was the last C project in 42 Common Core. I worked with Maxime to make this one work. We created a Ray Tracer capable of drawing sphere, cylinder, plane and triangle.

## Goals

This project goals were:
* Implement in C a Ray Tracer with all the maths and physics behind rendering
* Use multi-threading to optimize.
* Implement texture mapping on objects.

## Spotlights

This RayTracer is able to draw triangles. Therefore, it can draw all figures composed of triangles. This was not the most difficult thing to do. There is plenty of literature on how to know if a ray is crossing a triangle but the end view is impressive.

## Lessons Learned

The teamwork was interesting on this one. At this point in the curriculum, I was used to working with Maxime. We had already worked on a couple of projects and we knew how to do this. We were pair programming a lot and used TDD whenever we could. On this project though, pair programming didn't work. As we were understanding the maths behind that at different paces, we only figured out together how to draw a plane. When we both understood the concept behind Ray tracing, we decided to split the work. He was much better than me at understanding the maths behind. Working this way gave me some time to familiarize with the concept.
