# ft_transcendence - Pong Platform

This is a full-stack web platform built with Django and vanilla JavaScript where users can register, create profiles, and play Pong against each other in real-time. The platform features user authentication, matchmaking, live gameplay, and game history tracking. This was the final project of 42's common core curriculum, completed as a team effort.

The frontend is built with vanilla JavaScript to handle the game rendering on HTML5 Canvas and real-time communication with the server. The backend uses Django for user management, game history, and serving the application. The core innovation is a dedicated Python WebSocket server using asyncio that manages multiple concurrent Pong games, handling game state updates, player inputs, ball physics, and collision detection all in real-time while maintaining robust error handling to prevent server crashes.

## Goals

I created this project to learn three skills:
* Building a complete full-stack web application from authentication to real-time gameplay
* Implementing asynchronous Python with asyncio and WebSocket protocols for concurrent game management
* Working effectively as a team on a large project with multiple interconnected components

## Spotlights

I am particularly proud of the Pong game server I built. Using Python's asyncio library and a WebSocket framework, I created a server capable of handling multiple simultaneous games without blocking. Each game runs in its own coroutine, processing player inputs, updating ball positions, detecting collisions, and broadcasting state updates to both players at 60 frames per second. The main challenge was implementing comprehensive error handling to ensure that if one game encountered an error or a player disconnected unexpectedly, it wouldn't crash the entire server or affect other ongoing games. I implemented graceful degradation, connection recovery, and proper cleanup of resources, resulting in a stable server that could run for extended periods handling dozens of concurrent matches.

## Lessons Learned

This project was my deep dive into asynchronous programming in Python. I learned how asyncio's event loop works, the difference between concurrent and parallel execution, and how to structure async code effectively. Understanding when to use `await`, how to manage async context managers, and how to avoid blocking the event loop were crucial skills. I also learned about WebSocket protocols, connection lifecycle management, and the challenges of maintaining state across unreliable network connections.

Working as a team on a large project taught me invaluable collaboration skills. We had to coordinate between frontend and backend development, establish API contracts, manage a shared Git repository with multiple branches, conduct code reviews, and integrate our components. I learned the importance of clear communication, documenting decisions, and writing code that others can understand and maintain. We used task distribution, regular sync meetings, and pair programming for complex features. This experience showed me that technical skills alone aren't enough - successful projects require good teamwork, planning, and the ability to compromise on technical decisions for the benefit of the overall project.
