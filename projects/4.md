# Ray Tracer

This was the last C project in 42 Common Core. I worked with Maxime to make this one work. We created a Ray Trace capable of drawing sphere, cylinder, plane and triangle.

## Goals

This project goals were:
* Implements in C a Ray Tracer with all the maths and physics behind rendering 
* Use multi-threading to optimize.
* Implements texture mapping on object.

## Spotlights

This RayTracer is able to draw triangle. Therefore, it can draw all figure composed by triangle. This was not the most difficult thing to do. There is plenty of literature on how to know if a ray is crossing a triangle but the end view is impressive.

## Lessons Learned

The teamwork was interesting on this one. At this point in the curriculum, I was used to worked with Maxime. We already worked on a couple of project and we knew how to do that. We were pair programming a lot and use TDD whenever we could. On this project though, pair programming didn't work. As we were understanding the maths behind that at the different pace, we only figured out together how to draw a plane. When we both understood the concept behind Ray tracing, we decided to split the work. He was much better than me to understand the maths behind. Working this way gave me some time to familiarize with the concept.
