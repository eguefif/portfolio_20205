# GameBoy Emulator

This was my first Rust project. I first emulated the CPU, then the clock, the interrupt and finally the Pixel Processing Unit (PPU). I've learned so much about the interaction of the machine and low-level programs that handle interruptions.

## Goals

I created this project to learn three skills:
* Rust programming fundamentals including ownership, borrowing, and the type system
* Computer architecture and low-level programming concepts through hardware emulation

## Spotlights

I am particularly proud of getting Tetris to run fully playable. Achieving this milestone required implementing accurate CPU instruction execution, proper timing cycles, correct PPU behavior for tile-based graphics, and synchronized screen refresh rates. Seeing the iconic Tetris pieces fall smoothly on the screen for the first time was incredibly rewarding and confirmed that all the core systems were working together correctly.

## Current State

The emulator is only able to render Tetris correctly. Other games do not work. I need to rework the PPU emulation to allow other games to work. The sound is not working either.

## Lessons Learned

This project was a deep dive into low-level programming. I learned about memory representation, machine architecture, assembly and clocks. I also learned a lot about reading others' code. There isn't much documentation about how the GameBoy works. Most of the emulator authors are electronics geeks who reverse-engineered the chips and wrote the emulator. The documentation is in their code. It was insightful.
