# GameBoy Emulator

This was my first Rust project. I first emulate the CPU, then the clock, the interrupt and finally the Pixel Processing Unit (PPU). I've learned so much about the interaction of the machine and low level program that handles interruptions.

## Goals

I created this project to learn three skills:
* Rust programming fundamentals including ownership, borrowing, and the type system
* Computer architecture and low-level programming concepts through hardware emulation

## Spotlights

I am particularly proud of getting Tetris to run fully playable. Achieving this milestone required implementing accurate CPU instruction execution, proper timing cycles, correct PPU behavior for tile-based graphics, and synchronized screen refresh rates. Seeing the iconic Tetris pieces fall smoothly on the screen for the first time was incredibly rewarding and confirmed that all the core systems were working together correctly.

## Current State

The emulator is only able to render Tetris correctly. Other game does not work. I know that I have to rework the ppu emulation to allow other game to work. The sound is not working either.

## Lessons Learned

This project was a deep dive into low level programming. I learned about memory representation, machine architecture, assembly and clocks. I also learned a lot about reading someone's code. There is not a lot of documentation about how the GameBoy works. Most of the emulator author are electronic geek that reversed engineer the chips and write the emulator. The documentation is in their code. It was insightful.
